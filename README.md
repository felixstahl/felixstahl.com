# Felixstahl.com - My own sandbox
This is my own website, it will serve as some sort of CV (or more like an extension of my CV) and a place where I can experiment with stuff. It's very basic right now, but I have some future plans for it. I, for example, want to create a timeline including different projects and events, related to myself and my IT background. This will be done when motivation and spare time collide.
